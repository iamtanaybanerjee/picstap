## 🧠 Why I Built This

I built **Picstap** to deepen my understanding of building RESTful APIs with Node.js and PostgreSQL, while working with real-world third-party APIs like Unsplash. I wanted to solve a simple but relatable problem — how to easily find and organize images — and apply full-stack principles including data modeling, external API integration, and structured testing using Jest.

This project helped me gain hands-on experience with Sequelize ORM, error handling in async code, and best practices for writing clean, testable backend logic.
